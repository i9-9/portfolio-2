##What does it mean to transcend?

I think just many people, including myself, have or have had a misconception on what this actually means, or what it implies. 

One definition I am finding online right now goes like this: 

"be or go beyond the range or limits of (a field of activity or conceptual sphere).
"

or, a source nearer to me writes: 

"It is to make feel the effects or consequences of something in a place or environment other than where it originates."

So,

I think, many times, when we think about this idea, we bring the personality into the center of it. We think we transcend when our actions leave a legacy and are well known and influence the people who are intended to do so. 

But maybe, to transcend goes deeper than that. Maybe, to transcend could mean that the effects of our actions are felt somewhat distantly in time. I like this idea. Names might go along with it, my teacher would talk about Boddhidarma or the Buddha. Their influence is obvious given the fact that their lives are relatively well documented and known. 

But also, there are and have been anonymous people who maybe moved this information (the one sourcing in the Buddha e.g.) towards us, documented it, processed it, translated and a myriad of different processes, namelessly! Isn't that to transcend to ?
